Hello, World! Example

Introduction:
-------------
The C programming language is a general-purpose language that is close to how computers work.
C is widely used and is the foundation for many applications, including Windows, Python, and Git.

C is a compiled language. You must use a compiler (like GCC or Visual Studio) to convert your code
into an executable file.

About this program:
-------------------
- Every C program can use libraries, which provide useful functions.
- The 'printf' function, which prints text to the screen, is defined in the 'stdio.h' header file.
- The main function is where every C program starts executing.
- Returning 0 from main means the program ran successfully.

This program prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Print "Hello, World!" to the screen
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
