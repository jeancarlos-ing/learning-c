## üíª Compiling and Running C Code

To compile and run a C program, use a terminal and the GCC compiler:

```sh
gcc -o program program.c
./program
```

Replace `program.c` with your source file name.

**Common Compilation Flags:**

| Flag         | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-Wall`      | Enable all warnings                     |
| `-Wextra`    | Enable extra warnings                   |
| `-std=c11`   | Use the C11 standard                    |
| `-pedantic`  | Enforce strict standard compliance      |
| `-g`         | Include debug information               |

**Example:**

```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -pedantic -g -o myprog myprog.c
./myprog
```

## üß† Tips for Success

- **Start simple:** Focus on one concept at a time.
- **Experiment:** Change code and see what happens.
- **Read error messages:** They help you learn.
- **Practice regularly:** The more you code, the more you understand.
- **Ask questions:** Don‚Äôt hesitate to seek help or clarification.
- **Draw diagrams:** Visualize memory, pointers, and program flow.
- **Document your code:** Use comments to explain your logic.
- **Review and refactor:** Clean up and improve your code as you learn.
