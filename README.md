# Learn C

This repository contains basic C programming examples and tutorials. Each file in the `basics/` directory demonstrates a fundamental concept of the C language, such as variables, arrays, loops, functions, and more.

## Directory Structure

- `basics/`
  - `hello-world.c` — Your first C program.
  - `types-and-variables.c` — Introduction to variables and data types.
  - `arrays.c` — Working with arrays.
  - `strings.c` — Manipulating strings.
  - `conditions.c` — Using if/else and conditional logic.
  - `for-loops.c` — Using for loops.
  - `while-loops.c` — Using while loops.
  - `functions.c` — Defining and calling functions.
  - `multidimensional-arrays.c` — Working with multidimensional arrays.
  - `static.c` — (To be completed) Static variables in C.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile a C file, use `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection):

```sh
gcc basics/hello-world.c -o hello-world
./hello-world
```

Replace `hello-world.c` with any other file you want to compile.
