# Introduction to C

C is a foundational programming language that gives you direct control over memory and hardware. This guide will help you understand C from the ground up, with clear explanations, diagrams, examples, and practical advice.

## Why Learn C?

C is unique because it is "close to the machine." This means you can see how your code interacts with memory and hardware. Unlike higher-level languages, C does not protect you from mistakes—if you make an error, your program might crash. This can be challenging, but it also teaches you how computers really work.

**Why is C still important?**

- It is used in operating systems (like Linux), embedded systems, and high-performance applications.
- Many modern languages (like Go, Rust, Python, Java) are influenced by C.
- Learning C makes it easier to learn other languages and understand how computers operate.

## The Main Challenge: Pointers

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.  
**Analogy:** Imagine a pointer as a note with a house address. The note (pointer) tells you where the house (variable) is. You can have many notes pointing to the same house.

Pointers are powerful but can be confusing at first. Once you understand them, the rest of C becomes much easier.

## The Structure of a C Program

Let's look at the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### What does each part do?

- **`#include <stdio.h>`**  
  This line tells the preprocessor to include the Standard Input/Output library, which provides the `printf` function.

- **`int main(void)`**  
  Every C program starts executing from the `main` function. The `int` means the function returns an integer value.

- **`printf("Hello, World!\n");`**  
  Prints the message to the screen. `\n` is a newline character.

- **`return 0;`**  
  Signals that the program finished successfully.

### Diagram: Program Flow

```sh
[Start] --> [main()] --> [printf] --> [return 0] --> [End]
```

## Comments in C

Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to explain your code.

```c
// This is a single-line comment

/*
   This is a
   multi-line comment
*/
```

## Compilation: How C Code Becomes a Program

C is a **compiled language**. This means you must convert your `.c` source code into an executable file before you can run it.

### Compilation Steps

1. **Preprocessing:** Handles lines starting with `#` (like `#include`).
2. **Compilation:** Converts your code into machine code (object files).
3. **Linking:** Combines object files and libraries into a final executable.

### Diagram: Compilation Process

```sh
[hello.c] --(preprocessor)--> [processed code]
      |
      v
--(compiler)--> [object file]
      |
      v
--(linker)--> [executable]
      |
      v
--(run)--> [Hello, World!]
```

## How to Compile and Run

On Linux/macOS/WSL, use the terminal:

```sh
gcc -o hello hello.c
./hello
```

- `gcc` is the GNU Compiler Collection.
- `-o hello` names the output file `hello`.
- `hello.c` is your source file.

**Output:**

```sh
Hello, World!
```

**Tip:**  
Try compiling from the command line at least once, even if you use an IDE. It helps you understand how C programs are built.

## Compiling with Multiple Files

If your program has several source files, compile them together:

```sh
gcc -o myprog file1.c file2.c file3.c
```

This creates a single executable called `myprog`.

## Using Different Compilers

- **On macOS:**  
  The default compiler is Clang, but you can install GCC with Homebrew (`brew install gcc`).
- **On Windows:**  
  Use MinGW, Cygwin, or Visual Studio.
- **On Linux:**  
  GCC is usually pre-installed.

## Building from an IDE

Most IDEs (like Visual Studio, VS Code, Xcode) have buttons or shortcuts to build and run your code.

**Example:**

- Visual Studio: `Ctrl + F7` to build, `Ctrl + F5` to run.
- VS Code: `F5` to run with debugger (install the C/C++ extension).
- Xcode: `Command + B` to build, `Command + R` to run.

## C Language Versions

C has evolved over time. Each version adds features or fixes bugs.

| Version    | Year   | Notes                                              |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| K&R C      | 1978   | Original version by Kernighan & Ritchie            |
| C89/C90    | 1989/90| ANSI/ISO standardization                           |
| C95        | 1995   | Minor update, extended character support           |
| C99        | 1999   | Major update, added `//` comments, new features    |
| C11        | 2011   | Unicode, multi-threading, more safety              |
| C17/C18    | 2017/18| Bugfix update to C11                               |
| C23        | 2023   | Latest specification                               |

**To use a specific standard with GCC:**

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -pedantic foo.c
```

Or for the latest:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c23 -pedantic foo.c
```
